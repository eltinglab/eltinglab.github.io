# Abstract
We study the band structure of twinned and detwinned BaFe2As2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The combination of measurements in the ordered and normal states along four high-symmetry momentum directions $\Gamma$ / Z − X / Y enables us to identify the complex reconstructed band structure in the ordered state in great detail. We clearly observe the nematic splitting of the d<sub>xz</sub> and d<sub>yz</sub> orbitals as well as folding due to magnetic order with a wave vector of ( π , π , π). We are able to assign all observed bands. In particular we suggest an assignment of the electron bands different from previous reports. The high-quality spectra allow us to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the band structure of BaFe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>.
