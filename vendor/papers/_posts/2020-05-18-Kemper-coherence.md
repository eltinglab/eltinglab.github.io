# Abstract
We discuss the potential creation and measurement of coherences in both dispersive solids and qubit-like single levels using current generation time- and angle-resolved photoemission technology. We show that in both cases, when both the pump and the probe overlap energetically with the coherent levels, and when the probe preferentially measures one level as compared to the other, that the time-resolved photoemission signal shows a beating pattern at the energy difference between the levels. In the case of dispersive bands, this leads to momentum-dependent oscillations, which may be used to map out small energy scales in the band structure. We further develop the two-sided Feynman diagrams for time-resolved photoemission, and discuss the measurement of decoherence to gain insight into the characteristics of qubit and dispersive bands.
