My name is Omadillo, and I come from a small rural village in Uzbekistan. I have been involved with physics since my high school years.  Presently, I am pursuing a doctoral degree in physics at NC State. I am interested in studying nonequilibrium phenomena in correlated materials using various numerical techniques. Current research topics include relaxation and thermalization dynamics of nonequilibrium populations in quasi-2D systems.

Omadillo is currently doing a postdoc at University of Texas El Paso.
