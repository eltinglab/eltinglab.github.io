During Marc's time in the lab, he used fluorescence microscopy to study k-fiber structure and dynamics and the mechanical interaction between the S. pombe spindle and nuclear envelope. Outside the lab, I enjoyed playing/watching sports and spending time outdoors.

Marc successfully defended his PhD in December 2022. He then started a position as a postdoctoral researcher in Karen Schindler's group at Rutgers University.
