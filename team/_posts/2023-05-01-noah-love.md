I’m an undergraduate here at NC State majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I joined Dr. Elting’s lab in the summer of 2023. The interdisciplinary and holistic approach to research made me interested in our lab and in biophysics generally. In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, creative writing, and biking.
