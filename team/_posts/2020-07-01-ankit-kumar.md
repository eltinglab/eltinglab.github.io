Ankit Kumar completed his masters [BS-MS dual degree] from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER Mohali Punjab, India). He joined NC State in 2014 and started working in the group in 2016. Currently, he is looking at the dynamics of Cooper pairs in 2D superconductors when an ultra-fast laser pulse drives the system out of an equilibrium state. He uses Non-equilibrium Green Functions approach with Many Body Perturbation Series to simulate the dynamics of Cooper pairs.

Ankit is currently a Consultant and Data Scientist at EY DnA Perth.
