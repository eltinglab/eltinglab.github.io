I’m a Research Technician in the Elting Lab at NC State University, where I’ve been a member since January 2023. I first joined the lab as an undergraduate researcher and transitioned into a full-time technician role in January 2025 after completing my B.S. in Structural and Molecular Biochemistry with a minor in Microbiology at NC State. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and was honored to be a Goodnight Transfer Scholar during my time at NC State. I’ve worked on projects using confocal fluorescence microscopy to analyze spindle elongation and nuclear envelope behavior in S. pombe, as well as protein analysis of the SFI1 protein in _Spirostomum_.
