Avinash Rustagi joined the Kemper Lab in 2016 as a postdoctoral researcher after graduating from the University of Florida. His research interests include non-equilibrium properties of condensed matter systems using tools of many-body perturbation theory as well as semi-classical methods. He works on a variety of projects, including the study of Electron-Hole liquids in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (formation and characteristics), photoemission from electron-hole bound states i.e. excitons, density-functional theory calculations.

After departing, he went to join the group of Pramey Upadhyahya in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue university.

He now works at Intel as a device engineer.
