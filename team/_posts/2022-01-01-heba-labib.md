Heba got her bachelor’s degree from Zewail City in Egypt in 2021, immediately joined NCSU as a Physics PhD student and one semester later, she joined our research group. Her research involves dealing with Green’s functions in efforts to describe and simulate the response of many-body interacting systems subject to high electric or magnetic fields. She is also interested in geometric quantum mechanics, topology, and exploring the strength of the evolving quantum computing era. What really intrigues her is how powerful and poetic mathematics is in showing how different physics fields and areas can get to meet in essence that the unrealistic magnetic monopole can seem to solidify and offer an elegant solution to existing difficult non-perturbative problems. In a less-of-physics state of being, Heba finds herself reading non-fiction, poetry, or classics.
