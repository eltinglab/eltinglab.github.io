Thomas Steckmann is an undergraduate physics and major major in the class of 2022. He joined the Kemper research group in 2020, and is researching efficient algebraic decompositions of lattice spin models in order to produce efficient and scalable methods for simulating these systems on quantum computers. In addition to working on quantum computing research, Thomas started the Quantum Information Club at NC State to increase access to quantum computing education for undergraduate students and to host workshops and hackathons. Previously, Thomas interned at Oak Ridge National Lab with Dr. Eugene Dumitrescu, and worked in the Ade research group on characterizing the morphological properties of ultra-thin organic transistors in order to better understand the influence of polymer formations on electrical performance.

Outside of quantum computing, Thomas enjoys science fiction, arguing about things he doesn't really understand (especially physics), and playing board or video games with friends.  

Thomas is currently attending graduate school at the University of Maryland.
