Norman completed their Bachelors in physics at University of Illinois at Chicago in 2021. After taking a specific interest in quantum mechanics in their final semesters, Norman joined the Quantum Theory Department at Fermilab over the summer where they focused on error mitigation techniques on noisy quantum hardware. Norman joined the group shortly after beginning their Physics PhD at NC State and now explores dynamical mean-field theory, a description that will help us to understand the electronic behavior of a material through mapping the many-body lattice problem to a local impurity site. Outside of being a graduate student, Norman enjoys spending time with their family and pets, making art, and listening to jazz.
