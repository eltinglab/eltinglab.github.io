I am a biomedical engineering student from West Chester University and I work in the Elting Lab through the Modeling the Dynamics of Biological Systems REU Program. Throughout the summer, I focused on the role of motor proteins in spindle elongation of S. Pombe. I am aspiring to continue research in graduate school pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering!
