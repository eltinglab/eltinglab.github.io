I'm a undergraduate at NC State studying Physics and Mathematics. I joined Dr. Elting's lab in the summer of 2025.  I love seeing the intersections of different fields coming together, especially with physics. My interests lie in medical and environmental science. Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, exercising, listening to music, and making art.
