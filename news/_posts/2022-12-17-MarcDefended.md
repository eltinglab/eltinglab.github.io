Marc Begley successfully defended his PhD in November and graduated on December 17. We are so happy for Marc and excited for his next adventure! After graduation, he plans to move to New Jersey and seek a position as a postdoctoral researcher.

The lab also celebrated the awarding of Mohamed Moshtohry's posthumous PhD at graduation, too. We sorely missed celebrating with Mohamed in person but are glad that his family could receive this degree and hope that it brings them some comfort.
