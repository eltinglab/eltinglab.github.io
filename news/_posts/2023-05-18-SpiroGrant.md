author: Mary Elting

The Elting Lab has been awarded a new grant from the National Science Foundation, in collaboration with the groups of Saad Bhamla (Georgia Tech), Fred Chang (UCSF), Scott Coyle (University of Wisconsin), Aaron Dinner (University of Chicago), Jerry Honts (Drake University), and Jane Maienschein (Marine Biological Laboratory and Arizona State University). This grant will allow us to take a multi-scale, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the ultrafast organismal scale contractions of the unicellular ciliate, Spirostomum, one of nature's fastest cells! We're thrilled to be able to continue our work with this highly interdisciplinary, collaborative (and all around fun!) team!
