# Abstract

We develop and exactly solve a model for electrons driven by pulsed or continuous ac fields. The theory includes both the photoexcitation process as well as the subsequent acceleration of the electrons. In the case of an ac response, we examine both the nonequilibrium density of states and the current. In the case of pulsed light for high harmonic generation, we find the radiated light assumes a nearly universal behavior, with only limited dependence on the parameters of the system, except for the amplitude of the driving field, which determines the range of high harmonics generated and a tendency toward a narrowing of the peaks in a charge density wave versus a metal. This type of high harmonic generation can potentially be used for the creation of solid-state-based ultrafast light sources.
