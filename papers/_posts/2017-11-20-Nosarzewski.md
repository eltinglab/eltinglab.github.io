# Abstract

Recent developments in the techniques of ultrafast pump-probe photoemission have made possible the search for collective modes in strongly correlated systems out of equilibrium. Including inelastic scattering processes and a retarded interaction, we simulate time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to study the amplitude mode of a d-wave superconductor, a collective mode excited through the nonlinear light-matter coupling to the pump pulse. We find that the amplitude mode oscillations of the d-wave order parameter occur in phase at a single frequency that is twice the quasi-steady-state maximum gap size after pumping. We comment on the necessary conditions for detecting the amplitude mode in trARPES experiments.
