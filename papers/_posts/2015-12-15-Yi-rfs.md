# Abstract

We present a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the substitution dependence of the electronic structure of Rb0.8Fe2(Se1-zSz)(2) (z = 0, 0.5, 1), where superconductivity is continuously suppressed into a metallic phase. Going from the nonsuperconducting Rb0.8Fe2S2 to superconducting Rb0.8Fe2S2, we observe little change of the Fermi surface topology, but a reduction of the overall bandwidth by a factor of 2. Hence, for these heavily electron-doped iron chalcogenides, we have identified electron correlation as explicitly manifested in the quasiparticle bandwidth to be the important tuning parameter for superconductivity, and that moderate correlation is essential to achieving high T-C.
